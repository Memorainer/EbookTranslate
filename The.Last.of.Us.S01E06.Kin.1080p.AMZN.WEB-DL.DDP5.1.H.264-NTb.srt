Here you will find various utilities and patches that help with downloading and maintaining your Creative Cloud apps.

The 'bypass unlicensed disablements' folder contains a script that prevents Adobe from locking unlicensed apps and/or
initiating a countdown for disablement.

The 'restore install buttons [beta]' folder contains patched files which convince Creative Cloud you have a subscription,
replacing the "Try" buttons with "Install", bypassing any credit card requirements and enabling native installation.

The 'bypass payment' folder contains a script rule which bypasses the credit card requirement on the "Try" button via
a firewall rule.

Depending on your system configuration, one of these approaches for bypassing payment may work better than the other.
Start with one of them. If you experience issues, fallback to the other approach. Keeping both methods applied is not
recommended.

More detailed information on usage is included in each folder.
