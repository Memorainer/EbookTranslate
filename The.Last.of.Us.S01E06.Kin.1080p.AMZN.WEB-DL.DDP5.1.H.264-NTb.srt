This script will stop any unlicensed app warnings, disablements, or countdown timers you may encounter
while using your patched applications by blocking licensing & genuine software integrity web requests.

Note: several Adobe related endpoints will be written in the "hosts" file. To remove these entries,
re-run "Patch.bat" and you will be prompted the option for automatic removal.

For manual removal, launch Notepad as administrator, open "hosts" in "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc"
and remove all entries starting with "ic.adobe.com" through "workflow-ui-prod.licensingstack.com".
Save it in the same directory.
