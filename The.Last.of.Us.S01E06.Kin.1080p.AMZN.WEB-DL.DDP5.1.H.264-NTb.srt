This script allows you to bypass payment requirements in Creative Cloud Desktop when clicking "Try". It is unnecessary
to run this script if you have restored the "Install" buttons.

IMPORTANT: This script assumes you have Microsoft Defender Firewall enabled for your active network, which is default.

To use, launch "Patch.bat" and follow the on-screen instructions. For reversal, re-launch "Patch.bat".

Troubleshooting and Info:
If you have disabled Microsoft Defender Firewall or have your firewalls managed by other network security
software (i.e. McAfee, Norton, Avast), the payment bypass will not take effect. Consider re-enabling Microsoft
Defender Firewall temporarily while you download your apps.

If Creative Cloud experiences connectivity issues after running the script, re-run it again to reverse the firewall rule,
launch Creative Cloud Desktop and allow it to load the apps panel, then re-run the script again once it loads and you'll
be able to download your apps.

If you prefer to keep third party network security software managing your firewalls, you can manually create
an outbound firewall rule in your managing program that disallows "Adobe Desktop Service.exe" from being able
to access the Internet, located in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\ADS".
