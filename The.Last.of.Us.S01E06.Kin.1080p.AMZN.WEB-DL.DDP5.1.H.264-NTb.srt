These patched files will convince Creative Cloud that you have an active subscription to all apps, and replace
the "Try" button with "Install", allowing you to immediately download your apps & bypass any requests for payment.

To use, place both "AppsPanelBL.dll" and "AppsPanelIL.dll" in the directory
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\AppsPanel", in place of the two existing files.

IMPORTANT: Make a backup of the originals; do not override them directly.

The patch should take effect the next time Creative Cloud is launched. If it doesn't, restart your PC.

Creative Cloud may experience performance issues on startup and prompt you to relaunch the app or restart your PC.
These messages can be safely ignored; give it time and it will eventually load.
