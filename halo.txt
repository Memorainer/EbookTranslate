1
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:15,904
Henry, give me the gun.

2
00:01:15,904 --> 00:01:17,572
Come on, give me the gun.

3
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:18,656
What did I do?

4
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:20,658
Gimme the gun.

5
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:22,994
Gimme the gun, Henry.

6
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:24,537
Gimme the gun.

7
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:26,539
Henry, no!

8
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:28,851
And the gun.

9
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:31,354
Who the hell are you?

10
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:33,898
Just someone passin' through.

11
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:38,111
Take the gun out, two fingers only,
put it outta reach.

12
00:02:46,703 --> 00:02:47,620
Why didn't you shoot him?

13
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,872
The gun's all the way over there.

14
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,961
- He didn't hurt me, by the way.
- Yeah, I got eyes.

15
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:57,296
You made him soup?

16
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:59,507
Yeah, I did.

17
00:02:59,507 --> 00:03:02,051
- It's cold out.
- I'm lookin' for my brother.

18
00:03:04,178 --> 00:03:06,764
- Well, I ain't seen him.
- I haven't told you what he looks like.

19
00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:08,933
- He look anything like you?
- A bit.

20
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,310
- Then I ain't seen him.
- He's got a girl with him.

21
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,146
Can I come down?

22
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:15,732
No. Ellie!

23
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:20,820
What did I just say?

24
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,572
Joel, come on.
They're like a thousand.

25
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:25,491
- Who's this little psycho?
- Never mind her.

26
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:27,035
I need you to tell us where we are.

27
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:28,661
If you got a map, why you lost?

28
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:31,247
Must've missed all the street signs
in the enormous fucking forest.

29
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:32,248
Ho-ly.

30
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:38,004
We're somewhere here.
Exactly where?

31
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:40,381
And your answer better be
the same as your wife's.

32
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:42,967
Did you tell him the truth?

33
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:44,218
Yeah.

34
00:03:44,677 --> 00:03:46,554
Are you tellin' me the truth?

35
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:48,014
Yeah.

36
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,322
Well, you found
a great place to hide, I guess.

37
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:05,281
Hide?

38
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:08,284
Came here before you were born, sonny.

39
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:11,454
- Get the hell away from everybody.
- I didn't want to.

40
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:16,626
Listen, I didn't mean to upset you
about your brother,

41
00:04:16,626 --> 00:04:18,211
but if you've come this far,

42
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:20,421
then you know what's out there.

43
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:22,173
- You seen Cody?
- Yeah, got close enough.

44
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:23,633
It's crawling with Infected.

45
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:27,178
Yeah, Laramie and Wind River Reservation.

46
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:30,181
Anywhere people used to be,
you can't go there no more.

47
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:32,934
- So you haven't heard the name Tommy?
- Nope.

48
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:34,143
What about the Fireflies?

49
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:36,020
We get those in the summer.

50
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,022
Not the bugs, the people.

51
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:39,398
There are firefly people?

52
00:04:43,402 --> 00:04:47,115
- You got any advice on the best way west?
- Yeah.

53
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:49,826
Go east.

54
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:53,579
But you never go past the river here.

55
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:57,708
- Ever.
- What's past the river?

56
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,918
Death.

57
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,546
We never seen who's out there,

58
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:04,674
but we see the bodies they leave behind.

59
00:05:05,383 --> 00:05:07,927
Some Infected, some not.

60
00:05:08,427 --> 00:05:12,348
If your brother's west of the river,
he's gone.

61
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:18,688
You're not gonna scare us.

62
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:20,815
Scared him.

63
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:36,747
You don't seriously believe them.

64
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:38,249
They've lived here a long time.

65
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,336
- Put that back.
- They don't know anything.

66
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:43,880
Never heard of the Fireflies.

67
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:51,095
Joel? Joel?

68
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:52,263
Joel, are you okay?

69
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:53,681
- Joel?
- Shut up.

70
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:54,807
Holy shit, are you dying?

71
00:05:55,808 --> 00:05:56,851
I'm okay.

72
00:05:56,851 --> 00:05:59,020
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, are you okay?

73
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,354
- I'm fine.
- No, no, but are you?

74
00:06:00,354 --> 00:06:02,356
Because just a reminder
that if you're dead, I'm fucked.

75
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:03,733
- I said I'm fine.
- Okay.

76
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:08,613
It's just the cold air all of a sudden.

77
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:13,451
All right.

78
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:18,372
So let's go and find Tommy
and the Fireflies.

79
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:20,958
It's gonna be easy.

80
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:24,086
All we have to do
is cross the River of Death.

81
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:52,657
The River of Death. Scary.

82
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:55,660
Don't start.

83
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:58,955
It's too close to dark.

84
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:00,331
There's some caves along the river.

85
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:02,583
We'll set up camp there,
cross in the mornin'.

86
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,252
Good. I'm starving.

87
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:05,503
Should've stolen two rabbits.

88
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:06,921
We can get our own rabbits.

89
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:08,339
You gonna teach me how?

90
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:11,050
Just keep movin'.

91
00:07:39,662 --> 00:07:41,998
Come down from there.
You're gonna break your neck.

92
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,929
Can I have some?

93
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:58,848
- No.
- What? Just to warm up.

94
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:00,016
C'mon.

95
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:16,157
Yep, still gross.

96
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,334
So I've been thinking.

97
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:30,379
Let's say we find the Fireflies,
it all works,

98
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,590
they draw my blood and put it through

99
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,967
some of their fancy machines
and make a cure.

100
00:08:36,302 --> 00:08:37,303
Okay?

101
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:38,512
Then what?

102
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:41,932
- Like, what do we do?
- It's "we"?

103
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:45,186
Okay, fine. Whatever. You.

104
00:08:45,186 --> 00:08:47,396
You can do anything you want.

105
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,857
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

106
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:52,318
It's never been an option.

107
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:55,029
Maybe

108
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:58,783
an old farmhouse, some land

109
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,618
a ranch.

110
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:02,370
Cool. What kind?

111
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,038
Sheep.

112
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:06,707
- I would raise sheep.
- Sheep.

113
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,168
They're quiet

114
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:11,212
do what they're told.

115
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:12,838
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

116
00:09:14,173 --> 00:09:16,926
So, just you and a buncha sheep.

117
00:09:17,802 --> 00:09:18,928
Romantic.

118
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:24,600
And what about you?
Where are you gonna go?

119
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:33,567
It's probably because I grew up in the QZ.

120
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,027
Behind you, there's ocean,

121
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:37,279
and ahead of you, there's a wall.

122
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,906
Nowhere else to look but up.

123
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:42,034
I read everything I could
in the school library.

124
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:45,329
Neil Armstrong,
Buzz Aldrin, Jim Lovell.

125
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:46,706
But you know who my favorite is?

126
00:09:46,706 --> 00:09:50,334
- Sally Ride.
- Sally fuckin' Ride!

127
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:52,920
Best astronaut name ever.

128
00:10:05,724 --> 00:10:07,268
It'll work, right?

129
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,395
The vaccine?

130
00:10:10,354 --> 00:10:12,565
It's a little late to start wonderin'.

131
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:16,902
- I tried, with Sam.
- Tried what?

132
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:19,155
I knew he was infected.

133
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:21,490
I rubbed some of my blood into his bite.

134
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,950
I know, I know, it was stupid.

135
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,160
But I

136
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:28,456
I wanted to save him.

137
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:36,297
Well, I reckon it's a lot
more complicated than that.

138
00:10:36,964 --> 00:10:40,718
Marlene, she's a lotta things,
but she's no fool.

139
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:43,679
If she says they can do it,
they can do it.

140
00:10:52,354 --> 00:10:54,064
You wanna take first watch or second?

141
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:56,775
I'll do both.

142
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:58,194
Get some sleep.

143
00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:02,072
Dream of

144
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:05,534
sheep ranches on the moon.

145
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:07,411
I will.

146
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:28,933
Still mumbling in your sleep.

147
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:31,101
I woke up early.

148
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:32,728
You were passed out,
so I took second watch.

149
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:34,230
You gotta wake me up if that happens.

150
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:37,691
- You can't do things like this.
- But I can.

151
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:39,610
'Cause I just did.

152
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:41,987
I'm responsible for you, okay?

153
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:43,531
Then don't fall asleep.

154
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:47,076
I was quiet, I checked my six,

155
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:49,411
I looked for tracks,
I found the high ground,

156
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:50,704
and I kept watch.

157
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:52,831
Like you taught me to.

158
00:11:53,832 --> 00:11:56,001
What can I say, man?
I'm a natural.

159
00:12:08,222 --> 00:12:09,682
You wake me up next time.

160
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:11,976
Yes, sir.

161
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:29,493
The River of Death. Still no people.

162
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:31,537
Fine.

163
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,806
I'm learning how to whistle.

164
00:13:32,806 --> 00:13:33,932
You don't know how to whistle?

165
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:35,851
Does it sound like
I know how to whistle?

166
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:36,727
No.

167
00:13:39,063 --> 00:13:41,732
Seriously, though,
how the fuck do you do that?

168
00:13:41,732 --> 00:13:43,651
- Talent.
- Whatever.

169
00:13:43,651 --> 00:13:45,110
You should teach me how to hunt.

170
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,362
Huh.

171
00:13:46,362 --> 00:13:49,698
"Huh." Like, "She's a girl.
She can't handle it."

172
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:51,909
You can handle the shootin'.

173
00:13:52,618 --> 00:13:55,579
- Not so sure about the dressin'.
- What's the dressin'?

174
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:58,207
- The part where you take the guts out.
- Oh, yeah.

175
00:13:58,207 --> 00:13:59,625
Why do they call it dressing?

176
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,960
{\an8}It's like, you should call it undressing

177
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,754
{\an8}'cause it is. It's like

178
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:06,382
{\an8}undressing from the inside.

179
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:10,844
{\an8}Still interested, though.

180
00:14:21,397 --> 00:14:22,523
Dam.

181
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:25,150
You're no Will Livingston.

182
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,152
Yeah, yeah, but who is?

183
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:30,781
- So that made electricity?
- Yeah.

184
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,659
Don't ask me.
I don't have a clue.

185
00:14:34,535 --> 00:14:36,620
You know, you could've
just made something up.

186
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,913
I would've believed you.

187
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:43,001
Look at that river.
It's crazy blue.

188
00:14:50,008 --> 00:14:53,762
Hey, Joel, what if this
is the River of Death?

189
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,835
Get behind me.

190
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:30,340
We ain't lookin' for any trouble.

191
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,050
We're just passin' through.

192
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,010
Drop the gun.

193
00:15:45,564 --> 00:15:46,356
You

194
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:48,442
take five steps back.

195
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:49,902
How 'bout we just talk this through?

196
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:51,111
How 'bout you shut the fuck up?

197
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:52,738
Okay, easy.

198
00:15:58,202 --> 00:15:59,536
You'll be okay.

199
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:03,457
You been near Infected?

200
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:04,625
There's no Infected out here.

201
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,834
The hell there ain't.

202
00:16:11,215 --> 00:16:12,549
Last chance for a bullet.

203
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:17,304
If you've been infected, he will smell it
and he will rip you up.

204
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:38,408
Like I said, we'll just move on.

205
00:16:39,952 --> 00:16:40,994
Now her.

206
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:11,859
Hi. Hi!

207
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:14,236
Hi.

208
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:24,621
You just bought yourself
10 more seconds.

209
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:26,456
What are you doin' out here?

210
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,668
I'm just lookin' for my brother.

211
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:31,253
That's all, nothin' more.

212
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:39,261
What's your name?

213
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,015
Joel.

214
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,968
Tommy!

215
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:31,123
What the fuck you doin' here?

216
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:34,793
I came here to save you.

217
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,481
There's more if you need it.

218
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:57,983
Thank you, ma'am.

219
00:19:58,608 --> 00:20:00,569
It's been a while
since we've had a proper meal.

220
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:02,404
Actually, I don't think
I've ever had a proper meal.

221
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:04,031
This is fuckin' amazing.

222
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:06,533
Sorry.

223
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:07,576
Ellie,

224
00:20:07,576 --> 00:20:09,244
let's mind our manners.

225
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,584
What?

226
00:20:16,877 --> 00:20:19,046
- What's wrong with you?
- What about her manners?

227
00:20:19,046 --> 00:20:20,922
She was just curious.

228
00:20:20,922 --> 00:20:23,216
Kids around here
don't usually look or talk like you.

229
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:25,927
Right, well, maybe I'll teach them.

230
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:29,473
And I want my gun back.

231
00:20:29,473 --> 00:20:31,308
They also aren't armed.

232
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:33,018
You know what?

233
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:36,438
I think maybe y'all got a little off
on the wrong foot.

234
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:37,939
She was gonna have her guys kill us.

235
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:40,192
Well, we gotta be real careful
about who we let in this place.

236
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:41,818
But it's all bark.
We're just tryna scare off

237
00:20:41,818 --> 00:20:43,320
those who might wanna try us is all.

238
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,696
Well, you got a couple of 90-year-olds

239
00:20:44,696 --> 00:20:46,490
- shitting themselves out there.
- Ellie.

240
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,200
They say that you leave
dead bodies around?

241
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,576
Those are the people who tried us.

242
00:20:49,576 --> 00:20:52,245
A bad reputation doesn't mean you're bad.

243
00:20:52,245 --> 00:20:54,247
Not always, at least.

244
00:20:58,835 --> 00:20:59,753
Ma'am,

245
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:02,964
we're grateful for
your hospitality and all.

246
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,843
But it'd be nice to have a moment here,
maybe just for family.

247
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:10,514
Well

248
00:21:12,224 --> 00:21:15,060
Maria is family, actually.

249
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:18,939
Oh, shit! Congrats.

250
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:23,902
Joel, say congrats.

251
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:28,281
Congrats.

252
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,288
- How 'bout a tour?
- Yeah.

253
00:21:36,456 --> 00:21:38,625
We settled here about seven years ago.

254
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,335
Just a handful of us back then.

255
00:21:40,335 --> 00:21:42,629
That section was already
a gated community,

256
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:45,090
so we built the rest of the wall
out from there.

257
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,427
Stopped most of the raiding parties,
but we still find pockets of them.

258
00:21:48,427 --> 00:21:51,304
- And you said Infected?
- Yeah, but usually smaller colonies,

259
00:21:51,304 --> 00:21:52,597
wandered off from the cities.

260
00:21:52,597 --> 00:21:54,516
All this open country out here,

261
00:21:54,516 --> 00:21:56,226
it's a turkey shoot.

262
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:59,229
I still got my 700,
but I found a variable power scope.

263
00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:00,856
Sub-MOA.

264
00:22:00,856 --> 00:22:02,732
Can headshot those fuckers
from a half mile out.

265
00:22:02,732 --> 00:22:05,360
- Can you teach me how?
- No, he can't.

266
00:22:06,153 --> 00:22:08,488
- How do you keep this place quiet?
- Carefully.

267
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:09,614
Being in the middle of nowhere helps.

268
00:22:09,614 --> 00:22:12,159
Not advertising what we have,
staying off the radio.

269
00:22:13,118 --> 00:22:14,828
House of worship, multifaith.

270
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:17,164
School. Laundry.

271
00:22:17,164 --> 00:22:19,958
Old bank works as the jail,
not that we've needed it.

272
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,585
And you draw power from the dam?

273
00:22:21,585 --> 00:22:23,503
Got that workin' a couple years ago.

274
00:22:23,503 --> 00:22:26,590
After that, sewage, plumbing,
water heaters,

275
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,757
lights.

276
00:22:27,757 --> 00:22:29,885
This place actually fuckin' works.

277
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:34,472
Hey, Joel, check it.

278
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:41,813
So are you, like, in charge?

279
00:22:41,813 --> 00:22:43,899
No one person's in charge.

280
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:45,108
I'm on the council.

281
00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:46,443
Democratically elected,

282
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:48,695
serving 300 people, including children.

283
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:49,946
Everyone pitches in.

284
00:22:49,946 --> 00:22:52,073
We rotate patrols, food prep, repairs,

285
00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:53,450
hunting, harvesting.

286
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,493
Everything you see in our town,

287
00:22:55,493 --> 00:22:58,663
greenhouses, livestock, all shared.

288
00:22:58,663 --> 00:23:00,081
Collective ownership.

289
00:23:00,624 --> 00:23:02,292
So, communism.

290
00:23:03,418 --> 00:23:04,753
Nah.
Nah, it ain't like that.

291
00:23:04,753 --> 00:23:06,338
It is that. Literally.

292
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:07,714
This is a commune.
We're communists.

293
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:12,302
- No way!
- That's our newest one.

294
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:14,512
Couple months old.
You wanna pet her?

295
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:16,264
- Yeah, what's her name?
- Shimmer.

296
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:18,391
Shimmer. You're so beautiful.

297
00:23:18,391 --> 00:23:20,810
Well, I'm sure they'd like a shower,
some new clothes.

298
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,938
We can put them in the empty house
cross the street from us.

299
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:25,106
Yeah. It's a decent place.

300
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:27,901
Pretty much untouched since '03,
but it's got the heat goin' in it.

301
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:30,654
- Could do worse.
- Trust me, we have been.

302
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:32,447
We've been doin' fine.

303
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:39,287
Well, I'll take Ellie over there
if you two wanna catch up?

304
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:42,499
Yeah. Okay.

305
00:23:44,668 --> 00:23:46,586
- Joel.
- You'll be fine.

306
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,464
Shall we?

307
00:23:50,382 --> 00:23:51,299
Yeah.

308
00:23:57,389 --> 00:23:59,099
Been a long time.

309
00:24:03,603 --> 00:24:05,772
Doesn't seem like you aged much.

310
00:24:05,772 --> 00:24:07,023
You, on the other hand.

311
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:14,990
Thanks for still givin' a shit about me.

312
00:24:22,122 --> 00:24:24,249
Workin' on raisin' some hogs, too.

313
00:24:24,874 --> 00:24:27,168
Once we get bacon,
I mean, what's even left?

314
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:31,715
Christmas trees and bacon?

315
00:24:31,715 --> 00:24:33,758
Pretty decent setup.

316
00:24:34,634 --> 00:24:36,177
So how's Tess?

317
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:39,556
She's fine.

318
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:41,766
- All right.
- Good then.

319
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:44,269
And the kid?

320
00:24:46,229 --> 00:24:47,772
Oh, yeah.

321
00:24:48,898 --> 00:24:51,484
She's the daughter
of some Firefly muckety-muck.

322
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:54,571
Tryna find her family somewhere out here.

323
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:57,657
- I was headin' in this direction, so.
- Really?

324
00:24:58,616 --> 00:24:59,659
Goodness of your heart?

325
00:25:00,702 --> 00:25:01,786
There's a payment.

326
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:07,459
So you know where they might be?
These Fireflies?

327
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:10,628
Well, they got a base down at
the University of Eastern Colorado.

328
00:25:11,546 --> 00:25:14,090
It's a week's ride south.

329
00:25:15,258 --> 00:25:17,385
But it is severely fucked up
between here and there.

330
00:25:18,428 --> 00:25:20,847
Infected, raiders.

331
00:25:20,847 --> 00:25:22,557
It's not exactly an easy trip.

332
00:25:22,557 --> 00:25:25,310
It'll be easy for us, seeing as how
you can headshot Infected

333
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,478
from half a mile away,

334
00:25:26,478 --> 00:25:28,688
which is a bunch
of bullshit, by the way.

335
00:25:30,148 --> 00:25:32,317
- Yeah, I can't go.
- Come on.

336
00:25:32,317 --> 00:25:33,777
I made it across the country.

337
00:25:33,777 --> 00:25:36,071
The two of us can make it
from here to Colorado.

338
00:25:40,825 --> 00:25:42,118
What, 'cause your wife won't let you?

339
00:25:42,118 --> 00:25:44,662
- Joel.
- She the one who kept you off the radio?

340
00:25:44,662 --> 00:25:46,456
Is that why you stopped messaging me back?

341
00:25:46,456 --> 00:25:49,584
After I ditched the Fireflies,
Maria and her crew found me.

342
00:25:50,335 --> 00:25:51,878
They're good people.

343
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,381
They didn't have to take me in,
but they did.

344
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:56,132
And all they ask
is that I follow their rules.

345
00:25:56,132 --> 00:25:58,551
- I'm your brother.
- Yeah, I'm aware.

346
00:26:00,136 --> 00:26:02,305
They're very protective of this place,

347
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:03,681
and for good fuckin' reason.

348
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:06,476
- Folks find out we're up here--
- No, I heard.

349
00:26:06,476 --> 00:26:08,520
Wrong people might show up.

350
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,231
So is that what I am?
Am I the wrong people?

351
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:12,941
- Joel--
- Those things I did, Tommy,

352
00:26:12,941 --> 00:26:14,734
those things that you judge me for,

353
00:26:14,734 --> 00:26:16,319
I did those things to keep us alive.

354
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:17,779
We did those things.

355
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:19,531
And they weren't "things."

356
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:21,408
We murdered people.

357
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:24,119
And I don't judge you for it.

358
00:26:25,036 --> 00:26:27,205
We survived the only way we knew how.

359
00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:29,207
But there were other ways.

360
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:32,335
We just weren't any good at 'em.

361
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:33,878
If you knew the shit
that I've been through,

362
00:26:33,878 --> 00:26:35,755
Tommy, tryin' to find you these
last few months--

363
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:37,340
I'm gonna be a father.

364
00:26:38,883 --> 00:26:40,802
{\an8}Maria's a few months along now.

365
00:26:42,303 --> 00:26:44,222
{\an8}So I just gotta be more careful.

366
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:51,938
{\an8}To be honest,
I'm scared to death.

367
00:26:54,983 --> 00:26:58,570
But I don't know.
I feel like I'd be a good dad.

368
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:06,369
Guess we'll find out.

369
00:27:09,873 --> 00:27:11,833
"I guess we'll find out"?

370
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:14,794
- That's all you got?
- What else am I supposed to say?

371
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:21,718
Just because life stopped for you

372
00:27:23,178 --> 00:27:25,513
doesn't mean it has to stop for me.

373
00:27:31,728 --> 00:27:35,231
We'll grab some supplies
and be outta your hair in the mornin'.

374
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,884
Gross.

375
00:29:52,994 --> 00:29:54,120
Hello?

376
00:30:03,338 --> 00:30:04,464
Maria?

377
00:30:39,332 --> 00:30:40,667
Oh, good.

378
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:43,878
Just traded for this.
Go ahead, try it on.

379
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:52,720
It's super fuckin' purple.

380
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,722
- Eggplant. It fits?
- Yeah.

381
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:57,141
- Shoes aren't too big?
- No.

382
00:30:57,141 --> 00:30:59,519
- Where's my other stuff?
- Rag pile.

383
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,270
- Did you get the thing I left you?
- Yeah.

384
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,690
- Weirdest gift ever.
- But useful.

385
00:31:04,232 --> 00:31:07,527
- Who's been cutting your hair?
- World-class salons.

386
00:31:08,486 --> 00:31:09,779
Let me get my scissors.

387
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:11,447
- No. I'm--
- Trim. That's all.

388
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:13,449
Just the ends, I promise.

389
00:31:16,911 --> 00:31:19,664
So, this was, like,
your job back then or something?

390
00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:24,794
No, I was an Assistant District Attorney
out of Omaha, Nebraska.

391
00:31:26,212 --> 00:31:27,547
I put bad guys in jail.

392
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:29,966
Cool, I guess.

393
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:33,720
I always liked doing hair, though.
Maybe it was a mom thing.

394
00:31:34,846 --> 00:31:36,889
You were looking at the little memorial
Tommy made?

395
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:38,641
Yeah.

396
00:31:40,852 --> 00:31:43,688
- I'm sorry about your kids.
- It's okay.

397
00:31:43,688 --> 00:31:45,231
And kid. Just Kevin.

398
00:31:46,065 --> 00:31:47,984
Sarah was Joel's daughter.

399
00:31:52,905 --> 00:31:56,242
- Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.
- No, it's okay.

400
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:00,538
I guess that explains him a little.

401
00:32:01,414 --> 00:32:02,790
Look, I'm not gonna ask you
what you're doing with him.

402
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,750
Good.

403
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,668
But there are clearly things
you don't know about Joel.

404
00:32:05,668 --> 00:32:08,671
Like how he used to kill people?
I know about that.

405
00:32:11,007 --> 00:32:13,176
- So then you understand my concern.
- He doesn't do that anymore.

406
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:16,053
- He stopped killing people?
- Innocent ones.

407
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:18,431
And Tommy did it, too.
Are you worried about him?

408
00:32:21,642 --> 00:32:23,436
Tommy was following Joel.

409
00:32:23,436 --> 00:32:26,481
- The way you are now.
- Well, maybe I'm smarter than Tommy.

410
00:32:26,481 --> 00:32:27,732
No offense.

411
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:29,984
You are definitely smart.

412
00:32:29,984 --> 00:32:32,153
Would've made a hell of a lawyer.

413
00:32:33,905 --> 00:32:36,032
There's a whole lot you're not telling me.

414
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:38,201
Good.

415
00:32:39,285 --> 00:32:41,037
Therein lies the point.

416
00:32:41,954 --> 00:32:44,040
Be careful who you put your faith in.

417
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:48,294
The only people who can betray us,
are the ones we trust.

418
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:52,215
You understand?

419
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,636
Now, come on.

420
00:32:56,636 --> 00:32:59,055
Grab your super fuckin' eggplant coat.

421
00:32:59,055 --> 00:33:01,474
- Where are we going?
- The movies.

422
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:08,439
<i>Elliot Garfield.
I'm moving into the other room.</i>

423
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,944
<i>Yeah. I'm a friend of Tony's,
you know, Tony DeForrest.</i>

424
00:33:14,362 --> 00:33:15,363
<i>That's nice.</i>

425
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:17,406
<i>I'm an actor, too.</i>

426
00:33:18,324 --> 00:33:19,575
<i>Yeah?</i>

427
00:33:19,575 --> 00:33:21,577
<i>Well, your mother knows.</i>

428
00:33:21,577 --> 00:33:22,995
<i>I see.</i>

429
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,706
<i>Well</i>

430
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,960
<i>guess I'll be seeing you around.</i>

431
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,546
-<i>I guess so.</i>
-<i>Night.</i>

432
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:36,259
<i>Just met Lucy.</i>

433
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:37,760
<i>What did you tell her?</i>

434
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,136
<i>That I was moving into the other room.</i>

435
00:33:39,136 --> 00:33:40,680
<i>She seemed to take it in stride.</i>

436
00:33:58,364 --> 00:34:00,116
The guys said I might find you here.

437
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:05,329
Figured I'd save you the trouble.

438
00:34:14,547 --> 00:34:16,465
I shouldn't have said what I said.

439
00:34:17,884 --> 00:34:19,635
I don't even believe it.

440
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:23,598
I know you're happy for me.
It just--

441
00:34:24,974 --> 00:34:26,601
It's complicated for you

442
00:34:27,268 --> 00:34:28,603
and I'm sorry.

443
00:34:32,106 --> 00:34:33,691
So you gonna let me
off the hook, or what?

444
00:34:33,691 --> 00:34:36,694
This ride to the University,
is it a suicide mission?

445
00:34:37,236 --> 00:34:38,487
No.

446
00:34:38,487 --> 00:34:41,073
It's dangerous,
but it's nothin' you can't handle.

447
00:34:41,073 --> 00:34:42,408
Just prepare and do what you do.

448
00:34:42,408 --> 00:34:44,535
You've had people go that way
and come back?

449
00:34:44,535 --> 00:34:45,745
All of 'em.

450
00:34:46,787 --> 00:34:47,914
What is this?

451
00:34:51,334 --> 00:34:52,668
She's immune.

452
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:56,756
- What?
- Ellie.

453
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,175
She got infected but she didn't get sick.

454
00:35:00,092 --> 00:35:01,010
Tommy.

455
00:35:02,053 --> 00:35:05,139
Tommy, I saw her get bit myself.

456
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:07,350
That was months ago. Months.

457
00:35:08,184 --> 00:35:09,727
She's immune.

458
00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:30,998
From the beginning.

459
00:35:34,669 --> 00:35:36,420
<i>It was Marlene.</i>

460
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,799
<i>She hired us to smuggle her
to some Fireflies.</i>

461
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:41,842
<i>It went bad.</i>

462
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:43,970
<i>Tess got bit.</i>

463
00:35:45,388 --> 00:35:47,306
<i>She made me swear to take the kid.</i>

464
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:50,017
<i>It was her dyin' wish.</i>

465
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:52,019
<i>What the hell was I supposed to do?</i>

466
00:35:53,729 --> 00:35:56,273
<i>We made it as far as K.C., and then--</i>

467
00:35:57,358 --> 00:35:59,860
You know, she saved my life there

468
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,487
from another kid.

469
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:04,865
Five years ago, I would've destroyed him.

470
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:08,119
But she had to shoot him to save me.

471
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,745
Fourteen years old.

472
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:14,250
Because I was too slow
and too fuckin' deaf to hear him comin'.

473
00:36:16,836 --> 00:36:18,379
And I saw

474
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:23,009
I saw a man kill his own brother

475
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,929
to save her, while I just watched.

476
00:36:27,638 --> 00:36:29,432
And today, I thought that dog
was gonna tear her apart

477
00:36:29,432 --> 00:36:31,642
because it smelled somethin' on her.

478
00:36:32,268 --> 00:36:33,769
And all I did was stand there.

479
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:37,398
I couldn't move.

480
00:36:38,107 --> 00:36:40,109
I couldn't think of anything to say.
I just--

481
00:36:42,987 --> 00:36:44,530
I was so afraid.

482
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:50,661
You think I can still handle things but

483
00:36:51,495 --> 00:36:53,039
I'm not who I was.

484
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:55,374
I'm weak.

485
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,418
Lately, there are these moments

486
00:36:57,418 --> 00:36:59,837
where the fear comes up outta nowhere and

487
00:37:00,629 --> 00:37:01,756
my heart

488
00:37:02,506 --> 00:37:04,425
feels like it's stopped.

489
00:37:09,472 --> 00:37:10,723
And I have dreams.

490
00:37:13,434 --> 00:37:14,560
Every night.

491
00:37:15,186 --> 00:37:16,729
What kinda dreams?

492
00:37:17,229 --> 00:37:20,566
I don't know. I can't remember.

493
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,569
I just know that when I wake up

494
00:37:26,947 --> 00:37:28,866
I've lost somethin'.

495
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,952
I'm failin' in my sleep.

496
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,914
That's all I do.

497
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:37,500
It's all I've ever done

498
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,834
is fail her

499
00:37:39,543 --> 00:37:41,087
again and again.

500
00:37:42,671 --> 00:37:43,839
You want me to take her.

501
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,092
I'm just gonna get her killed.

502
00:37:46,092 --> 00:37:47,301
I know it.

503
00:37:48,177 --> 00:37:49,887
I have to leave her.

504
00:37:51,514 --> 00:37:52,431
Joel.

505
00:37:53,057 --> 00:37:55,476
It's why you took off on me, right?

506
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:57,686
To make up for the things we did?

507
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:03,818
Well, here's your chance
to bring your kid into a better world.

508
00:38:03,818 --> 00:38:05,569
You're younger than me.
You're still strong.

509
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:07,780
You said it yourself, you'll come back.

510
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,406
You have to take her.

511
00:38:15,996 --> 00:38:18,415
And you can't tell anyone, not even Maria.

512
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:21,877
Tommy, you're the only one I trust.

513
00:38:21,877 --> 00:38:25,631
If anyone else sees those bites on her,
what's under her skin,

514
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:27,258
they'll shoot her.

515
00:38:29,677 --> 00:38:32,138
It's the last thing I'll ever ask of you.

516
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,516
I swear.

517
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:51,490
I'll take her out at dawn.

518
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:09,967
We got you in 38.
It's left, left, right.

519
00:39:23,105 --> 00:39:25,482
<i>I have a feeling
you'd rather be alone, Luce.</i>

520
00:39:25,482 --> 00:39:28,360
<i>He'll know we thought it was lousy
if we don't say hello.</i>

521
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,321
<i>All right.
But try and be tactful.</i>

522
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:32,489
-<i>What's tactful?</i>
-<i>Lie.</i>

523
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:36,827
<i>Hello?</i>

524
00:39:36,827 --> 00:39:39,830
<i>Mr. Garfield? It's Lucy and me.</i>

525
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:45,169
<i>We just came back to tell you
how much we enjoyed it.</i>

526
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:46,795
<i>I had the best time.</i>

527
00:39:46,795 --> 00:39:48,631
<i>At first,
I thought it was gonna be boring.</i>

528
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:09,026
Ellie?

529
00:40:19,036 --> 00:40:21,163
Is this really
all they had to worry about?

530
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,250
Boys. Movies.

531
00:40:25,084 --> 00:40:27,628
Deciding which shirt
goes with which skirt.

532
00:40:28,963 --> 00:40:30,297
It's bizarre.

533
00:40:33,926 --> 00:40:36,053
- Listen,
- Why are you here?

534
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:40,266
- I came here to talk to you.
- No, why are you still here?

535
00:40:40,266 --> 00:40:42,184
If you're gonna ditch me, ditch me.

536
00:40:44,937 --> 00:40:46,480
What exactly did you hear?

537
00:40:48,524 --> 00:40:51,068
"I have to leave her.
You have to take her."

538
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,574
You know, I stood up for you
today because I thought--

539
00:41:02,705 --> 00:41:05,666
I made this decision for your own good.

540
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:07,668
You'll be way better off with Tommy.

541
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:10,170
He knows the area better than I do--

542
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,381
- Do you give a shit about me or not?
- Of course, I do.

543
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:14,591
Then what are you so afraid of?

544
00:41:18,846 --> 00:41:20,514
I'm not her, you know?

545
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:25,811
- Maria told me about Sarah and--
- Don't.

546
00:41:30,232 --> 00:41:31,775
Don't say another word.

547
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:37,239
I'm sorry about your daughter, Joel.

548
00:41:38,657 --> 00:41:40,200
But I have lost people, too.

549
00:41:41,243 --> 00:41:43,370
You have no idea what loss is.

550
00:41:45,247 --> 00:41:47,416
Everybody I have cared for

551
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:50,044
has either died or left me.

552
00:41:50,586 --> 00:41:53,255
Everybody, fucking except for you!

553
00:41:53,255 --> 00:41:55,591
So don't tell me that I'd be safer
with somebody else

554
00:41:55,591 --> 00:41:58,761
because the truth is
I would just be more scared.

555
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,436
You're right.

556
00:42:08,896 --> 00:42:10,439
You're not my daughter.

557
00:42:11,231 --> 00:42:13,400
And I sure as hell ain't your dad.

558
00:42:15,486 --> 00:42:17,029
Now, come dawn

559
00:42:18,155 --> 00:42:20,282
we're goin' our separate ways.

560
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,836
Come in.

561
00:44:17,107 --> 00:44:18,150
Stables.

562
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:44,426
You came here to say goodbye or something?

563
00:44:44,426 --> 00:44:45,302
No.

564
00:44:46,261 --> 00:44:48,180
I came here to steal
one of these horses and go.

565
00:44:49,014 --> 00:44:50,057
I woulda gave you one.

566
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:51,642
I know.

567
00:44:52,392 --> 00:44:53,352
Anyway

568
00:44:54,102 --> 00:44:56,188
that was 30 minutes ago, and I guess

569
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:00,943
you deserve a choice.

570
00:45:00,943 --> 00:45:02,444
I still think you'd be better off
with Tommy--

571
00:45:02,444 --> 00:45:03,695
Let's go.

572
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:05,489
Okay.

573
00:45:25,968 --> 00:45:27,052
Hold onto both.

574
00:45:30,514 --> 00:45:31,890
General direction?

575
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:34,810
Head southeast till you hit I-25.

576
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:37,396
It's right off the interstate.
Shouldn't be hard to miss.

577
00:45:53,537 --> 00:45:56,248
There's a place for you here.
Both of you.

578
00:45:57,207 --> 00:45:58,750
Countin' on it.

579
00:46:03,338 --> 00:46:04,381
Can I borrow that?

580
00:46:05,716 --> 00:46:06,633
Yeah.

581
00:46:06,633 --> 00:46:08,385
'Cause Maria took mine, you know?

582
00:46:08,385 --> 00:46:10,387
I already said yes, Joel.

583
00:46:17,561 --> 00:46:19,396
<i>Adios,</i> big brother.

584
00:46:34,703 --> 00:46:36,038
Close it up.

585
00:47:00,479 --> 00:47:01,396
Wide right.

586
00:47:01,396 --> 00:47:03,523
- You're flinchin'.
- The target's too small.

587
00:47:03,523 --> 00:47:05,567
I made it bigger than I should've.
Eject the cartridge.

588
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:09,029
And I am not flinching.

589
00:47:09,655 --> 00:47:12,074
- The rifle just sucks.
- Okay, give it.

590
00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:14,868
It doesn't aim right.

591
00:47:14,868 --> 00:47:15,911
You'll see.

592
00:47:17,496 --> 00:47:19,164
A deep breath in, slow breath out.

593
00:47:19,164 --> 00:47:21,166
You squeeze the trigger like you love it.

594
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:23,085
Gentle,

595
00:47:23,085 --> 00:47:25,504
steady, nice and slow.

596
00:47:25,504 --> 00:47:26,880
You gonna shoot this thing
or get it pregnant?

597
00:47:29,049 --> 00:47:31,343
It isn't gonna work. It doesn't aim right.

598
00:47:33,595 --> 00:47:35,931
You dick.

599
00:47:59,538 --> 00:48:02,416
So the way they ran stuff in Jackson,
was how things used to be?

600
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:03,792
No.

601
00:48:03,792 --> 00:48:06,128
The country was too big for that.

602
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:09,172
Back then, there were basically
two main ways of lookin' at things.

603
00:48:09,172 --> 00:48:11,717
Some people wanted to own everything.

604
00:48:12,384 --> 00:48:15,137
And some people didn't want anyone
to own anything at all.

605
00:48:16,304 --> 00:48:17,764
Which one were you?

606
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:19,766
Neither. I just did my job.

607
00:48:20,392 --> 00:48:22,477
Which was building?

608
00:48:22,477 --> 00:48:24,062
That's right.

609
00:48:24,062 --> 00:48:26,606
Houses, stores, that kinda thing.

610
00:48:26,606 --> 00:48:28,608
We were called "contractors."

611
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,487
"The Contractor."

612
00:48:33,363 --> 00:48:34,906
That's pretty cool.

613
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:37,576
Yeah. We were cool.

614
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,036
Everybody loved contractors.

615
00:48:40,746 --> 00:48:41,663
Nice.

616
00:48:53,925 --> 00:48:56,094
Okay, so if you mess up your fourth down,

617
00:48:56,094 --> 00:48:57,554
then you give the ball to the other team?

618
00:48:58,138 --> 00:48:59,890
Right.
It's called a "turnover."

619
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:01,099
Turnover.

620
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:04,519
But if you make it to 10 yards,

621
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:06,480
then you're back to first down?

622
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,481
Yep.

623
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:12,402
So, basically just moving
in one direction.

624
00:49:12,402 --> 00:49:13,612
Basically.

625
00:49:14,404 --> 00:49:17,949
- But violent.
- Oh. Well. There's that.

626
00:49:19,242 --> 00:49:22,204
Well, how 'bout that?
Made it in five days.

627
00:49:22,204 --> 00:49:25,832
Easy days. I don't know what
Tommy was so afraid of.

628
00:49:25,832 --> 00:49:27,793
Still time to find out.

629
00:49:27,793 --> 00:49:29,503
"Still time to find out."

630
00:49:30,212 --> 00:49:33,548
"The Contractorrrr."

631
00:49:46,186 --> 00:49:49,564
Home of the Big Horns.
What does that mean?

632
00:49:49,564 --> 00:49:50,899
Team mascot.

633
00:49:51,817 --> 00:49:53,068
It's a kind of sheep.

634
00:49:53,068 --> 00:49:54,277
See?

635
00:49:54,277 --> 00:49:56,279
One step closer to your dream.

636
00:49:56,947 --> 00:49:58,240
Don't see any Fireflies, though.

637
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,242
They're probably in the middle.

638
00:50:00,242 --> 00:50:01,910
Safer.

639
00:50:04,162 --> 00:50:05,497
This way.

640
00:50:14,923 --> 00:50:16,424
So these places

641
00:50:17,217 --> 00:50:18,927
people would live here and, like, what?

642
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:20,971
- Go to classes and stuff?
- Yup.

643
00:50:20,971 --> 00:50:24,224
- Even though they were adults.
- Sort of adults.

644
00:50:24,224 --> 00:50:26,810
I think it was just as much about partying

645
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:29,062
and findin' themselves as anythin' else.

646
00:50:29,062 --> 00:50:31,439
Figuring out what they wanted to do
with their lives.

647
00:50:31,439 --> 00:50:33,984
What they wanted to do with their lives.

648
00:50:35,986 --> 00:50:37,529
So I've been thinkin'.

649
00:50:38,572 --> 00:50:39,906
I don't want a sheep ranch, actually.

650
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:41,283
I mean, if the deal is I can do anything?

651
00:50:41,283 --> 00:50:42,868
That's the deal.

652
00:50:42,868 --> 00:50:44,286
Well

653
00:50:44,286 --> 00:50:46,162
when I was a kid,
I wanted to be a singer.

654
00:50:46,162 --> 00:50:47,455
Shut up.

655
00:50:48,582 --> 00:50:50,125
Why is that funny?

656
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:53,211
- You gotta sing something now.
- No.

657
00:50:53,211 --> 00:50:55,505
- Come on, man. I'm not gonna laugh.
- You're already laughin'.

658
00:50:55,505 --> 00:50:56,923
Yeah, okay, true.

659
00:50:57,716 --> 00:50:59,885
Well, you're singin' for me later.

660
00:50:59,885 --> 00:51:01,344
I'm gonna save the fuckin' world, man.

661
00:51:01,344 --> 00:51:03,346
It's the least you can do for me.

662
00:51:05,265 --> 00:51:06,600
Fair enough.

663
00:51:12,772 --> 00:51:14,065
Are those monkeys?

664
00:51:14,608 --> 00:51:16,109
Must be from the old labs.

665
00:51:16,943 --> 00:51:18,486
Look at them go.

666
00:51:18,486 --> 00:51:20,113
First time seein' a monkey?

667
00:51:20,113 --> 00:51:22,032
First time seein' a monkey.

668
00:51:26,703 --> 00:51:27,871
Lookit.

669
00:51:33,084 --> 00:51:34,210
Here we go.

670
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:42,093
- Guard stations.
- No guards.

671
00:51:44,387 --> 00:51:45,513
Yeah.

672
00:51:45,513 --> 00:51:46,514
Gun?

673
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:49,184
Yeah.

674
00:52:52,872 --> 00:52:54,457
There were definitely doctors here.

675
00:53:04,467 --> 00:53:05,802
This is a packing list.

676
00:53:06,469 --> 00:53:08,638
Somethin' you make before moving.

677
00:53:08,638 --> 00:53:09,973
They just left?

678
00:53:13,393 --> 00:53:14,936
Maybe not all of them.

679
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:04,778
Well, at least it ain't Clickers.

680
00:54:04,778 --> 00:54:06,780
Yeah, no Fireflies either.

681
00:54:07,614 --> 00:54:10,784
Maybe in all that research,
they turned into fuckin' monkeys.

682
00:54:28,009 --> 00:54:29,552
That's where they went?

683
00:54:29,552 --> 00:54:31,429
All the pins lead there.

684
00:54:31,429 --> 00:54:33,389
Maybe gettin' ahead of the weather,

685
00:54:33,389 --> 00:54:34,766
better facilities?

686
00:54:34,766 --> 00:54:36,059
I don't know.

687
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:39,187
- This way.
- Shut the fuck up.

688
00:54:54,828 --> 00:54:56,162
Out the back.

689
00:55:16,015 --> 00:55:17,684
- Ready?
- Yeah.

690
00:55:23,439 --> 00:55:27,569
Come here. Come here.
Come here. I got ya.

691
00:55:29,904 --> 00:55:30,697
Joel!

692
00:56:06,566 --> 00:56:07,984
Joel! Get on the horse!

693
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,195
Get on the horse.

694
00:56:12,363 --> 00:56:13,156
Joel!

695
00:56:17,577 --> 00:56:18,453
Get him!

696
00:56:18,453 --> 00:56:19,370
Go!

697
00:56:21,122 --> 00:56:21,956
Get back!

698
00:56:22,582 --> 00:56:23,374
Shit!

699
00:56:25,293 --> 00:56:26,461
You motherfucker!

700
00:56:34,344 --> 00:56:36,888
They're not following us.
I think we're safe.

701
00:56:37,722 --> 00:56:40,016
Joel?

702
00:56:40,683 --> 00:56:42,185
Joel, no, no, no! Shit!

703
00:56:42,185 --> 00:56:43,228
Fuck!

704
00:56:44,812 --> 00:56:45,855
Joel?

705
00:56:46,564 --> 00:56:47,607
Joel?

706
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:50,485
Shit.

707
00:56:51,653 --> 00:56:53,238
Joel, open your eyes.

708
00:56:53,238 --> 00:56:55,865
Open your eyes.
Joel, you gotta get up.

709
00:56:58,493 --> 00:57:00,745
I can't fuckin' do this without you.

710
00:57:00,745 --> 00:57:03,831
I don't know where the fuck I'm going,
what the fuck I'm gonna do.

711
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:05,917
Joel.

712
00:57:11,965 --> 00:57:13,091
Please.

713
00:57:15,051 --> 00:57:16,594
Joel, please.
